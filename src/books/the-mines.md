Always interested in the macabre and obscure, Tas loves traveling to explore abandoned and dangerous
dark tourism destinations. She’s fascinated by learning the often untold and violent histories of
forgotten places. When a journal from the diamond mining ghost town, Kolmanskop, Namibia,
mysteriously lands on her desk, she has the chance to learn her darkest one yet. It’s been her dream
to bring lost stories to life at the history museum and Kolmanskop touts a wealth of secrecy buried
beneath its sands. Secrets Tas wants to uncover.

But if dreams can come true, what about nightmares?

Dean’s debilitating anxiety attacks are triggered by his increasingly realistic dreams in which he
feels conscious and alive. Only when those dreams start playing out in real life does he question
whether they dictate his future or if he’s still in control. He’s terrified of the answer and
crippled with the very real possibility that his nightmares will soon fester to life.

Especially, the nightmare with Tas.
