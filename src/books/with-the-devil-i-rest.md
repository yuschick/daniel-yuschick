You cannot speak to Gods with languages of Man.

Lillian now leads the cult her father started with the belief that we’re all born with an innate
understanding of the true human language passed down from God. With the same torturous traditions he
set, she must raise a child to retain its innate language and translate messages she cannot read
herself. Messages that stand between her and the goal her father dedicated their lives to.

When Noah was born without the ability to speak, Lillian heralded him as a gift from the Gods, a
sign that she was getting close. At Lillian’s direction, Noah becomes the cult’s executioner, using
his holy hands to sacrifice the children who fail her. As the unsuccessful years wane, Lillian’s
devotion descends into macabre desperation, and Noah’s left to question his family, his fundamental
beliefs, and the only life he’s ever known.

Inspired by true events.
