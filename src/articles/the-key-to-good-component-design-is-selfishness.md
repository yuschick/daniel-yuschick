_When translating components from design to development, it‚Äôs common to find properties that relate
to the content and not to the component itself. This considerate approach to component design
creates complicated props, steeper learning curves and eventual technical debt. However, the key to
avoiding these pitfalls is selfish, or self-interested, component design._

---

When developing a new feature, what determines whether an existing component will work or not? And
when a component doesn‚Äôt work, what exactly does that mean?

Does the component functionally not do what it‚Äôs expected to do, like a tab system that doesn‚Äôt
switch to the correct panel? Or is it too rigid to support the designed content, such as a button
with an icon after the content instead of before it? Or perhaps it‚Äôs too pre-defined and structured
to support a slight variant, like a modal that always had a header section, now requiring a variant
without one?

Such is life of a component. All too often, they‚Äôre built for a narrow objective, then hastily
extended for minor one-off variations again and again until it no longer _works_. At which point, a
new component is created, and the technical debt grows, the onboarding learning curve becomes
steeper and the maintainability of the codebase is more challenging.

Is this simply the inevitable lifecycle of a component? Or can this situation be averted? And, most
importantly, if it _can_ be averted, how?

Selfishness. Or perhaps, self interest. Better yet, maybe a little of bit of both.

Far too often components are far too considerate. Too considerate of one another and, especially,
too considerate of their own content. In order to create components that scale with a product, the
name of the game is self-interest bordering on selfishness‚Äîcold-hearted, narcissistic,
the-world-revolves-around-me selfishness.

This article isn‚Äôt going to settle the centuries-old debate about the line between self-interest and
selfishness. Frankly, I‚Äôm not qualified to take part in any philosophical debate. However, what this
article _is_ going to do is demonstrate how building selfish components is in the best interest of
every other component, designer, developer and person consuming your content. In fact, selfish
components create so much good around them, you could almost say they‚Äôre selfless.

I don‚Äôt know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Let‚Äôs look at some components and decide for ourselves.

_Note: All code examples and demos in this article will be based around React and TypeScript.
However, the concepts and patterns are framework agnostic._

# The Consideration Iterations

Perhaps, the best way to demonstrate a considerate component is by walking through the lifecycle of
one. We‚Äôll be able to see how they start small and functional, but become unwieldy once the design
evolves. Each iteration backs the component further into a corner, until the design and needs of the
product outgrow the capabilities of the component itself.

Let‚Äôs consider the modest `Button` component. It‚Äôs deceptively complex and quite often trapped in
the consideration pattern, and therefor, a great example to work through.

## Iteration 1

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/design-iteration-01.jpeg", "A sample button design with two color variations." %}

While these sample designs are quite barebones, like not showing various `:hover`, `:focus` and
`disabled` states, they do showcase a simple button with two color themes.

At first glance, it‚Äôs possible the resulting `Button` component could be as barebones as the design.

```tsx
// First extend native HTML button attributes like onClick and disabled from React
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'> & {
    text: string;
    theme: 'primary' | 'secondary';
};

<Button onClick={someFunction} text="Add to cart" theme="primary" />;
```

It‚Äôs possible, and perhaps even likely, that we‚Äôve all seen a `Button` component like this. Maybe
we‚Äôve even made one like it ourselves. Some of the naming may be different, but the props, or the
API of the `Button`, are roughly the same.

In order to meet the requirements of the design, the `Button` defines props for the `theme` and
`text`. This first iteration works and meets the current needs of both the design and the product.

However, the current needs of the design and product are rarely the final needs. When the next
design iterations are created, the _Add to cart_ button now requires an icon.

## Iteration 2

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/design-iteration-02.jpeg", "A sample button design with multiple colors and new icon variant." %}

After validating the UI of the product, it was decided that adding an icon to the _Add to cart_
button would be beneficial. The designs explain, though, that not every button will include an icon.

Returning to our `Button` component, its props can be extended with an optional `icon` prop which
maps to the name of an icon to conditionally render.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
    theme: 'primary' | 'secondary';
    text: string;
    icon?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
};

<Button theme="primary" onClick={someFunction} text="Add to cart" icon="cart" />;
```

Whew! Crisis averted.

With the new `icon` prop, the `Button` can now support variants with or without an icon. Of course,
this assumes the icon will always be shown at the end of the text. Which, to the surprise of nobody,
is not the case when the next iteration is designed.

## Iteration 3

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/design-iteration-03.jpeg", "A sample button design which includes a third color variation." %}

The previous `Button` component implementation included the icon at the text‚Äôs end, but the new
designs require an icon to optionally be placed at the start of the text. The single `icon` prop
will no longer fit the needs of the latest design requirements.

There are a few different directions that can be taken for meeting this new product requirement.
Maybe an `iconPosition` prop can be added to the `Button`. But what if there comes a need to have an
icon on both sides? Maybe our `Button` component can get ahead of this assumed requirement and make
a few changes to the props.

The single `icon` prop will no longer fit the needs of the product, so it‚Äôs removed. In its place,
two new props are introduced, `iconAtStart` and `iconAtEnd`.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
    theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
    text: string;
    iconAtStart?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
    iconAtEnd?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
};
```

After refactoring the existing uses of `Button` in the codebase to use the new props, another crisis
is averted. Now, the `Button` has some flexibility. It‚Äôs all hardcoded and wrapped in conditionals
within the component itself, but surely, what the UI doesn‚Äôt know can‚Äôt hurt it.

Up until this point, the `Button` icons have always been the same color as the text. Seems
reasonable, and like a reliable default, but let‚Äôs throw a wrench into this well-oiled component by
defining a variation with a contrasting color icon.

## Iteration 4

In order to provide a sense of feedback, this confirmation UI stage was designed to be shown
temporarily when an item has been added to the cart successfully.

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/design-iteration-04.jpeg", "A sample button design now with an icon of a different color." %}

Maybe this is a time when the development team chooses to push back against the product
requirements. But despite the push, the decision is made to move forward with providing color
flexibility to `Button` icons.

Again, multiple approaches can be taken for this. Maybe an `iconClassName` prop is passed into the
`Button` to have greater control over the icon‚Äôs appearance. But there are other product development
priorities and, instead, a quick fix is done.

As a result, an `iconColor` prop is added to the `Button`.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
    theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
    text: string;
    iconAtStart?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
    iconAtEnd?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
    iconColor?: 'green' | '...other-theme-color-names';
};
```

With the quick fix in place, the `Button` icons can now be styled differently than the text. The UI
can provide the designed confirmation, and the product can, once again, move forward.

Of course, as product requirements continue to grow and expand, so do their designs.

## Iteration 5

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/design-iteration-05.jpeg", "A sample button design with only an icon as its content." %}

With the latest designs, the `Button` must now be used with only an icon. This can be done in a few
different approaches, yet again, but all of them require some amount of refactoring.

Perhaps a new `IconButton` component is created, duplicating all other button logic and styles into
two places. Or maybe that logic and styles are centralized and shared across both components.
However, in this example, the development team decides to keep all the variants in the same `Button`
component.

Instead, the `text` prop is marked as optional. This could be as quick as marking it as optional in
the props, but could require additional refactoring if there‚Äôs any logic expecting the `text` to
exist.

But then comes the question, if the `Button` is to have only an icon, which icon prop should be
used? Neither `iconAtStart` nor `iconAtEnd` appropriately describe the `Button`. Ultimately, it‚Äôs
decided to bring the original `icon` prop back, and use _it_ for the icon-only variant.

```tsx
type ButtonProps = {
    theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
    iconAtStart?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
    iconAtEnd?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
    iconColor?: 'green' | '...other-theme-color-names';
    icon?: 'cart' | '...all-other-potential-icon-names';
    text?: string;
};
```

Now, the `Button` API is getting confusing. Maybe a few comments are left in the component to
explain when and when not to use specific props, but the learning curve is growing steeper and the
potential for error is increasing.

For example, without adding great complexity to the `ButtonProps` type, there is no stopping a
person from using the `icon` and `text` props at the same time. This could either break the UI, or
be resolved with greater conditional complexity within the `Button` component itself. Additionally,
the `icon` prop can be used with either, or both, of the `iconAtStart` and `IconAtEnd` props as
well. Again, this could either break the UI or be resolved with even more layers of conditionals
within the component.

Our beloved `Button` has become quite unmanageable at this point. Hopefully, the product has reached
a point of stability where no new changes or requirements will ever happen again. Ever.

## Iteration 6

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/design-iteration-06.jpeg", "A sample button design with text content in different font formats." %}

So much for never having anymore changes ü§¶

This next, and final, iteration of the `Button` is the proverbial straw that breaks the camel‚Äôs
back. In the _Add to cart_ button, if the current item is already in the cart, we want to show the
quantity of which on the button. On the surface, this is a straight forward change of dynamically
building the `text` prop string. But the component breaks down because the current item count
requires a different font weight and an underline. Because the `Button` accepts only a plain text
string and no other child elements, the component no longer _works_.

Would this design have broken the `Button` if this was the second iteration? Maybe not. The
component and codebase were both much younger then. But the codebase has grown so much by this point
that refactoring for this requirement is a mountain to climb.

This is when one of the following things will likely happen.

1. Do a much larger refactor to move the `Button` away from a `text` prop, to accepting `children`.
   Or accepting a component or markup as the `text` value.
2. The `Button` is split into a separate `AddToCart` button with an even more rigid API specific to
   this one use case. This also either duplicates any button logic and styles into multiple places,
   or extracts them into a centralized file to share everywhere.
3. The `Button` is deprecated and a `ButtonNew` component is created, splitting the codebase,
   introducing technical debt, and increasing the onboarding learning curve.

Neither outcome is ideal.

So, where did the `Button` component go wrong?

# Sharing Is Impairing

What is the responsibility of an HTML `button` element exactly? Narrowing down this answer will
shine light onto the issues facing the previous `Button` component.

The responsibilities of the native HTML `button` element go no further than:

1. Display, without opinion, whatever content is passed into it
2. Handle native functionality and attributes such as `onClick` and `disabled`

Yes, each browser has its own version of how a `button` element may look and display content, but
CSS resets are often used to strip those opinions away. As a result, the `button` element boils down
to little more than a functional container for triggering events.

The onus of formatting any content within the `button` isn‚Äôt the responsibility of the `button`, but
of the content itself. The `button` shouldn‚Äôt care. The `button` should not share the responsibility
of its content.

> The core issue with considerate component design is that component props define the content and
> not the component itself.

In the previous `Button` component, the first major limitation was the `text` prop. From the first
iteration, a limitation was placed on the content of the `Button`. While the `text` prop fit with
the designs at that stage, it immediately deviated from the two core responsibilities of the native
HTML `button`. It immediately forced the `Button` to be aware of and responsible for its content.

In the following iterations, the icon was introduced. While it seemed reasonable to bake a
conditional icon into the `Button`, doing so also deviated from the core `button` responsibilities.
Doing so limited the use cases of the component. In later iterations, the icon needed to be
available in different positions, and the `Button` props were forced to expand to style the icon.

When the component is responsible for the content it displays, it needs an API that can accommodate
all content variations. Eventually, that API will break down because content will forever, and
always, change.

# Introducing The Me In Team

There‚Äôs an adage used in all team sports‚Äî‚Äùthere‚Äôs no I in team.‚Äù While this mindset is noble, some
of the greatest individual athletes have embodied other ideas.

Michael Jordan had famously responded with his own perspective. _‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an I in win.‚Äù_ The late
Kobe Bryant had a similar idea. _‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an M-E in [team].‚Äù_

Our original `Button` component was a team player. It shared the responsibility of its content until
it reached the point of deprecation. How could the `Button` have avoided such constraints by
embodying a _‚ÄúM-E in team"_ attitude?

# Me, Myself And UI

> When the component is responsible for the content it displays, it will break down because content
> will forever, and always, change.

How would a selfish component design approach have changed our original `Button`?

Keeping the two core responsibilities of the HTML `button` element in mind, the structure of our
`Button` component would have immediately been different.

```tsx
// First extend native HTML button attributes like onClick and disabled from React
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'> & {
    theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
};

<Button onClick={someFunction} theme="primary">
    <span>Add to cart</span>
</Button>;
```

By removing the original `text` prop in lieu of limitless `children`, the `Button` is able to align
with its core responsibilities. The `Button` can now act as little more than a container for
triggering events.

By moving the `Button` to its native approach of supporting child content, the various icon-related
props are no longer required. An icon can now be rendered anywhere within the `Button` regardless of
size and color. Perhaps the various icon-related props could be extracted into their own selfish
`Icon` component.

```tsx
<Button onClick={someFunction} theme="primary">
    <Icon name="cart" />
    <span>Add to cart</span>
</Button>
```

With the content-specific props removed from the `Button`, it can now do what all selfish characters
do best, think about itself.

```tsx
// First extend native HTML button attributes like onClick and disabled from React
type ButtonProps = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'> & {
    size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
    theme: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
    variant: 'ghost' | 'solid' | 'outline' | 'link';
};
```

With an API specific to itself and independent content, the `Button` is now a maintainable
component. The self-interest props keep the learning curve minimal and intuitive, while retaining
great flexibility for various `Button` use cases.

`Button` icons can now be placed at either end of the content.

```tsx
<Button onClick={someFunction} size="md" theme="primary" variant="solid">
    <Box display="flex" gap="2" alignItems="center">
        <span>Add to cart</span>
        <Icon name="cart" />
    </Box>
</Button>
```

Or, a `Button` could have only an icon.

```tsx
<Button onClick={someFunction} size="sm" theme="secondary" variant="solid">
    <Icon name="cart" />
</Button>
```

However a product may evolve over time, selfish component design improves the ability to evolve
along with it. Let‚Äôs go beyond the `Button` and into the cornerstones of selfish component design.

# The Keys to Selfish Design

Much like when creating a fictional character, it‚Äôs best to show, not tell, the reader that they‚Äôre
selfish. By reading about the character‚Äôs thoughts and actions, their personality and traits can be
understood. Component design can take the same approach.

But how exactly do we show in a component‚Äôs design and use that it is selfish?

## HTML Drives The Component Design

Many times, components are built as direct abstractions of native HTML elements like a `button` or
`img`. When this is the case, let the native HTML element drive the design of the component.

Specifically, if the native HTML element accepts children, the abstracted component should as well.
Every aspect of a component that deviates from its native element is something that must be learned
anew.

When our original `Button` component deviated from the native behavior of the `button` element by
not supporting child content, it not only become rigid, but it required a mental model shift just to
use the component.

There has been a lot of time and thought put into the structure and definitions of HTML elements.
The wheel doesn‚Äôt need to be reinvented every time.

## Children Fend For Themselves

If you‚Äôve ever read _‚ÄúLord of the Flies‚Äù,_ you know just how dangerous it can be when a group of
children are forced to fend for themselves. However, in the case of selfish component design, we‚Äôll
be doing exactly that.

As shown in our original `Button` component, the more it tried to style its content, the more rigid
and complicated it became. When we removed that responsibility, the component was able to do a lot
more, but with a lot less.

Many elements are little more than semantic containers. It‚Äôs not often we expect a `section` element
to style its content. A `button` element is just a very specific type of semantic container. The
same approach can apply when abstracting it to a component.

## Components Are Singularly Focused

Think of selfish component design as arranging a bunch of terrible first dates. A component‚Äôs props
are like the conversation that is entirely focused on them and their immediate responsibilities.

**‚ÄúHow do I look?‚Äù** Props need to feed the ego of the component. In our refactored `Button`
example, we did this with props like `size`, `theme` and `variant`.

**What am I doing?** A component should only be interested in what it and it alone, is doing. Again,
in our refactored `Button` component, we do this with the `onClick` prop. As far as the `Button` is
concerned, if there‚Äôs another click event somewhere within its content, that‚Äôs the content‚Äôs
problem. The `Button` does. not. care.

**When and where am I going next?** Any jet-setting traveler is quick to talk about their next
destination. For components like modals, drawers and tooltips, when and where they‚Äôre going is just
as gravely important. Components like these are not always rendered in the DOM. This means, that in
addition to knowing how they look and what they do, they need to know when and where to be. In other
words, this can be described with props like `isShown` and `position`.

## Composition Is King

Some components, such as modals and drawers, can often contain different layout variations. For
example, some modals will show a header bar while others do not. Some drawers may have a footer with
a call to action. Others may have no footer at all.

Instead of defining each layout in a single `Modal` or `Drawer` component with conditional props
like `hasHeader` or `showFooter`, break the single component into multiple composable child
components.

```jsx
<Modal>
    <Modal.CloseButton />
    <Modal.Header> ... </Modal.Header>
    <Modal.Main> ... <Modal.Main>
</Modal>


<Drawer>
    <Drawer.Main> ... </Drawer.Main>
    <Drawer.Footer> ... </Drawer.Footer>
</Drawer>
```

By using component composition, each individual component can be as selfish as it wants to be, and
used only when and where it‚Äôs needed. This keeps the root component‚Äôs API clean and can move many
props to their specific child component.

Let‚Äôs explore this, and the other keys to selfish component design, a bit more.

# You‚Äôre So Vain, You Probably Think This Code Is About You

Perhaps the keys of selfish design make sense when looking back at the evolution of our `Button`
component. Nevertheless, let‚Äôs apply them again to another commonly problematic component‚Äîthe modal.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 0.5em">

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/modal-iteration-1.jpeg", "A modal design for editing the display name and email address of a profile." %}

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/modal-iteration-2.jpeg", "A modal design for indicating a file has been uploaded successfully." %}

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/modal-iteration-3.jpeg", "A modal design for displaying the friends of an account." %}

</div>

For this example, we have the benefit of foresight into the three different modal layouts. This will
help steer the direction of our `Modal` while applying each key of selfish design along the way.

First, let‚Äôs go over our mental model and break down the layouts of each design.

In the **Edit Profile** modal, there are defined header, main and footer sections. There‚Äôs also a
close button. In the **Upload Successful** modal, there‚Äôs a modified header with no close button and
a hero-like image. The buttons in the footer are also stretched. Lastly, in the **Friends** modal,
the close button returns, but now the content area is scrollable and there‚Äôs no footer.

So, what did we learn?

We learned that the header, main and footer sections are interchangeable. They may or may not exist
in any given view. We also learned that the close button functions independently and is not tied to
any specific layout or section.

Because our `Modal` can be comprised of interchangeable layouts and arrangements, that‚Äôs our sign to
take a composable child component approach. This will allow us to plug and play pieces into the
`Modal` as needed.

This approach allows us to very narrowly define the responsibilities of our root `Modal` component.

1. Conditionally render with any combination of content layouts

That‚Äôs it. So long as our `Modal` is just a conditionally-rendered container, it will never need to
care about or be responsible for its content.

With the core responsibility of our `Modal` defined, and the composable child component approach
decided, let‚Äôs break down each composable piece and its role.

| **Component**           | **Role**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Modal>`               | This is the entry point of the entire `Modal` component. This container is responsible for when and where to render, how the modal looks, and what it does, like handle accessibility considerations.                                   |
| `<Modal.CloseButton />` | An interchangeable `Modal` child component that can be included only when needed. This component will work similarly to our refactored `Button` component. It will be responsible for how it looks, where it‚Äôs shown, and what it does. |
| `<Modal.Header>`        | The header section will be an abstraction of the native HTML `header` element. It will be little more than a semantic container for any content, like headings or images, to be shown.                                                  |
| `<Modal.Main>`          | The main section will be an abstraction of the native HTML `main` element. It will be little more than a semantic container for any content.                                                                                            |
| `<Modal.Footer>`        | The footer section will be an abstraction of the native HTML `footer` element. It will be little more than a semantic container for any content.                                                                                        |

With each component and its role defined, we can start creating the props to support those roles and
responsibilities.

**Modal**

Earlier, we defined the barebones responsibility of the `Modal`, knowing when to conditionally
render. This can be achieved using a prop like `isShown`. Therefor, we can use this props and
whenever it‚Äôs `true` the `Modal` and its content, will render.

```tsx
type ModalProps = {
    isShown: boolean;
};

<Modal isShown={showModal}>...</Modal>;
```

Any styling and positioning can be done with CSS in the `Modal` component directly. There‚Äôs no need
to create specific props at this time.

**Modal.CloseButton**

Given our previously refactored `Button` component, we know how the `CloseButton` should work. Heck,
we can even use our `Button` to build our `CloseButton` component.

```tsx
import { Button, ButtonProps } from 'components/Button';

export function CloseButton({ onClick, ...props }: ButtonProps) {
    return <Button {...props} onClick={onClick} variant="ghost" theme="primary" />;
}

<Modal>
    <Modal.CloseButton onClick={closeModal} />
</Modal>;
```

**Modal.Header, Modal.Main, Modal.Footer**

Each of the individual layout sections, `Modal.Header`, `Modal.Main` and `Modal.Footer` can take
direction from their HTML equivalents, `header`, `main` and `footer`. Each of these elements support
any variation of child content, and therefor, our components will do the same.

There are no special props needed. They serve only as semantic containers.

```jsx
<Modal>
    <Modal.CloseButton onClick={closeModal} />
    <Modal.Header> ... </Modal.Header>
    <Modal.Main> ... </Modal.Main>
    <Modal.Footer> ... </Modal.Footer>
</Modal>
```

With our `Modal` component and its child component defined, let‚Äôs see how they can be used
interchangeably to create each of the three designs.

_Note: The full markup and styles are not shown as to not take away from the core takeaways._

## Edit Profile Modal

In the **Edit Profile** modal, we use each of the `Modal` components. However, each is used only as
a container that styles and positions itself. This is why we haven‚Äôt included a `className` prop for
them. Any content styling should be handled by the content itself, not our container components.

```jsx
<Modal>
    <Modal.CloseButton onClick={closeModal} />

    <Modal.Header>
        <h1>Edit Profile</h1>
    </Modal.Header>

    <Modal.Main>
        <div className="modal-avatar-selection-wrapper"> ... </div>
        <form className="modal-profile-form"> ... </form>
    </Modal.Main>

    <Modal.Footer>
        <div className="modal-button-wrapper">
            <Button onClick={closeModal} theme="tertiary">
                Cancel
            </Button>
            <Button onClick={saveProfile} theme="secondary">
                Save
            </Button>
        </div>
    </Modal.Footer>
</Modal>
```

## Upload Successful Modal

Like in the previous example, the **Upload Successful** modal uses its components as opinionless
containers. The styling for the content is handled by the content itself. Perhaps this means the
buttons could be stretched by the `modal-button-wrapper` class, or we could add a _‚Äúhow do I look?‚Äù_
prop, like `isFullWidth`, to the `Button` component for a wider or full-width size.

```jsx
<Modal>
    <Modal.Header>
        <img src="..." alt="..." />
        <h1>Upload Successful</h1>
    </Modal.Header>

    <Modal.Main>
        <p> ... </p>
        <div className="modal-copy-upload-link-wrapper"> ... </div>
    </Modal.Main>

    <Modal.Footer>
        <div className="modal-button-wrapper">
            <Button onClick={closeModal} theme="tertiary">
                Skip
            </Button>
            <Button onClick={saveProfile} theme="secondary">
                Save
            </Button>
        </div>
    </Modal.Footer>
</Modal>
```

## Friends Modal

Lastly, our **Friends** modal does away with the `Modal.Footer` section. Here, it may be enticing to
the define the overflow styles on `Modal.Main` but that is extending the container‚Äôs
responsibilities to its content. Instead, handling those styles is better suited in the
`modal-friends-wrapper` class.

```jsx
<Modal>
    <Modal.CloseButton onClick={closeModal} />

    <Modal.Header>
        <h1>AngusMcSix's Friends</h1>
    </Modal.Header>

    <Modal.Main>
        <div className="modal-friends-wrapper">
            <div className="modal-friends-friend-wrapper"> ... </div>
            <div className="modal-friends-friend-wrapper"> ... </div>
            <div className="modal-friends-friend-wrapper"> ... </div>
        </div>
    </Modal.Main>
</Modal>
```

With a selfishly designed `Modal` component, we can accommodate evolving and changing designs with
flexible and tightly scoped components.

## Next Modal Evolutions

Given all that we‚Äôve covered, let‚Äôs throw around some hypotheticals regarding our `Modal` and how it
may evolve. How would _you_ approach these design variations?

A design requires a fullscreen modal. How would you adjust the `Modal` to accommodate a fullscreen
variation?

Another design is for a 2-step registration process. How could the `Modal` accommodate this type of
design and functionality?

<div style="display: flex; gap: 0.5em">

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/modal-iteration-4-1.jpeg", "A modal design showing step one of completing an account registration." %}

{% image "./src/assets/articles/selfish-design/modal-iteration-4-2.jpeg", "A modal design showing step two of completing an account registration." %}

</div>

# Recap

Components are the workhorses of modern web development. A greater importance continues to be placed
on component libraries, either standalone or as part of a design system. With how fast the web
moves, having components that are accessible, stable and resilient is absolutely critical.

Unfortunately, components are often built to do too much. They are built to inherit the
responsibilities and concerns of their content and surroundings. So many patterns that apply this
level of consideration break down further each iteration until a component no longer _works_. At
which point, the codebase splits, more technical debt is introduced and inconsistencies creep into
the UI.

If we break a component down to its core responsibilities, and build an API of props that only
define those responsibilities, without consideration of content inside of or around the component,
we build components that can be resilient to change. This selfish approach to component design
ensures a component is only responsible for itself, and not its content. Treating components as
little more than semantic containers means content can change or even move between containers
without effect. The less considerate a component is about its content and its surroundings, the
better for everybody. Better for the content that will forever change. Better for the consistency of
the design and UI which in turn is better for the people consuming that changing content. And,
lastly, better for the developers using the components.

The key to good component design is selfishness. Being a considerate team player is the
responsibility of the developer.
